##My DISMATH Weekly Portfolio
##Week 1
-- I was able to know the course Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).

--I also learned about truth tables. The truth table for conjuction is shown below.

| P | Q | P∧Q |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | **T** |
| T | F | **F** |
| F | T | **F** |
| F | F | **F** |

-- I learned about mathematical proofs, propositional statements, logical deductions and axioms.

-- I learned about propositional variables.


##Week 2
  These are some of the terminologies I knew about **Rules of Inference**
  
  -- Argument - A sequence of statements that end with a conclusion (p<sub>1</sub>∧p<sub>2</sub>∧p<sub>3</sub>∧...∧p<sub>n</sub>) → q
  
  -- Valid - The conclusion, or final statement of the argument, must follow from the truth of the preceding statements, or premises, of the argument.
  
  -- Fallacy - Common form of an incorrect reasoning that leads to an invalid argument.
  
  -- Tautology - Statement that is always *TRUE*.

##Week 3
  -- We had exercises about the Rules of Inference

  -- I learned how to use the Rules of Inference in arguments and premises

  -- I learned the difference between If-Then statements & If and only If (iff) statements.

##Week 4
  -- We discuused their main components as:argument, validity, and pattern.
  
  -- I learned about Predicate Logic that teaches us to tackle an argument not as a whole but in terms of subject and predicate
  
  -- We were also introduced to Quantifiers, Existential Quantifier ("There Exist") and Universal Quantifier ("For All"), to simplify general arguments 

- I learned about the different Methods of Proof.
  - Vacuous Proof
    * Steps:
      1. Show that p is false
      2. p→q must be true when p is false
      3. ¬p→(p→q)
  
  - Direct Proof
    * Steps:
      1. Assume p is true
      2. Show that q is also true, using (1).
  
  - Proof by Equivalence (p↔q)↔\|(p→q)∧(q→p)\|
    * Steps:
      1. Show that p→q is true
      2. Show that q→p is also true
  
  - Proof by Contraposition (Indirect Proof)
    * Steps:
      1. Assume ¬q is a hypothesis
      2. Show that ¬p must be true using definitions, and previously defined theorems.
  
  - Trivial Proof
    * Steps:
      1. Show that q is true
      2. p→q must also be true
      3. q→(p→q)
  
  - Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)
    * Steps:
      1. Assume ¬p
      2. Show that (1) ends up in a contradiction
      3. ∴ p is proven to be true
