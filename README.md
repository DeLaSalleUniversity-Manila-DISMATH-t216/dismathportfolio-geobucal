##My DISMATH Weekly Portfolio
##Week 1
-- I was able to know the course Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).

--I also learned about truth tables. The truth table for conjuction is shown below.

| P | Q | P∧Q |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | **T** |
| T | F | **F** |
| F | T | **F** |
| F | F | **F** |

-- I learned about mathematical proofs, propositional statements, logical deductions and axioms.

-- I learned about propositional variables.


##Week 2
  These are some of the terminologies I knew about **Rules of Inference**
  
  -- Argument - A sequence of statements that end with a conclusion (p<sub>1</sub>∧p<sub>2</sub>∧p<sub>3</sub>∧...∧p<sub>n</sub>) → q
  
  -- Valid - The conclusion, or final statement of the argument, must follow from the truth of the preceding statements, or premises, of the argument.
  
  -- Fallacy - Common form of an incorrect reasoning that leads to an invalid argument.
  
  -- Tautology - Statement that is always *TRUE*.

##Week 3
  -- We had exercises about the Rules of Inference

  -- I learned how to use the Rules of Inference in arguments and premises

  -- I learned the difference between If-Then statements & If and only If (iff) statements.

##Week 4
  -- We discuused their main components as:argument, validity, and pattern.
  
  -- I learned about Predicate Logic that teaches us to tackle an argument not as a whole but in terms of subject and predicate
  
  -- We were also introduced to Quantifiers, Existential Quantifier ("There Exist") and Universal Quantifier ("For All"), to simplify general arguments 

- I learned about the different Methods of Proof.
  - Vacuous Proof
    * Steps:
      1. Show that p is false
      2. p→q must be true when p is false
      3. ¬p→(p→q)
  
  - Direct Proof
    * Steps:
      1. Assume p is true
      2. Show that q is also true, using (1).
  
  - Proof by Equivalence (p↔q)↔\|(p→q)∧(q→p)\|
    * Steps:
      1. Show that p→q is true
      2. Show that q→p is also true
  
  - Proof by Contraposition (Indirect Proof)
    * Steps:
      1. Assume ¬q is a hypothesis
      2. Show that ¬p must be true using definitions, and previously defined theorems.
  
  - Trivial Proof
    * Steps:
      1. Show that q is true
      2. p→q must also be true
      3. q→(p→q)
  
  - Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)
    * Steps:
      1. Assume ¬p
      2. Show that (1) ends up in a contradiction
      3. ∴ p is proven to be true

  
#WEEK 5
Recursive/Inductive Definition
- We learned all about recursive algorithms
- There are two steps in solving through Recursive/Inductive Definition
  1. Basis Step
  and then
  2. Recursive Step

Hoare Triple
-- p{s}q,s=program segment

Power Series
-- We learned all about power series.
-- We were also taught how to represent different functions as power series.

Set Theory
-- We were introduced to Sets and Set Builder Notation.
-- Empty Set/Null Set = { } or ∅
     - A set without any elements
     
Cardinality
  -- |S|
  -- Number of elements a set contains

Subsets  
  -- A ⊆ B
  -- A is a subset of B if all elements of A are also elements of B

Power Set
  -- P(s) = {T|T⊆S}
  -- The power set of s is the set of all subsets that can be derived from set S.


##Week 6
-- We were introduced to Functions.
-- A function is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A.
-- Functions have 3 types namely One-to-one, Onto, and Bijection
-- We were also introduced to the difference between DOMAIN, CODOMAIN, and RANGE.


##Week 7
-- No Classes!


##Week 8
-- We were introduced according to sir the most important topic in DISMATH(Algorithms)
-- We were also given a glimpse of a simple algorithm. It is all about finding the maximum element in a given input using a finite set of integers
-- The pseudocode of an Algorithm was also introduced. It is a way of presenting an algorithm using the syntax of a programming language, but is intended for human reading.

  
##Week 9
--- We are lectured to the most simple algorithms. These algorithms were the Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Linear Search and the Greedy Change Algorithm.
 --Binary Search - compares the middle terms/value of a list then repeated until the desired output is found
 --Bubble Sort - compares the 1st and the 2nd element and changing them if they are in the incorrect order
 --Insertion Sort - compares the 2nd element with the 1st and inserts it before the 1st element if it is >, otherwise inserted after the 1st element
 

##Week 10
  - The topic for this week is about finding the number of comparisons a function/algorithm/program makes and the time it takes before getting the output.
-- The Big-O notation represents the upperbound function of a program, while the big-omega represents the lower bound, and big-theta represents the upper and lower bounds. 
-- This topic is important because it gives programmers an idea their program will do its job.


##Week 11
 - HOLY WEEK BREAK

 
##Week12
-- Handshake theorem is used to know how many edges are in a graph 2e=deg*vertex
- The concept of graphs were taught to us this week
- Euler Path and Euler Circuit is discussed.
- Hamilton Path, Hamilton Circuit was also discussed
- Matrices of a graph and Isomorphism of a graph was also taught.


##Week13
-- Trees, children and leaves were also taught
-- States, transitions and loops were introduced.
-- We were taught more about graphs like the color coding, homeomorphism
